We love instagram, its an app that we use to share best moments in our life!

We are thinking it would be cool to have one :)

Here are the features to implement:

## Users

- user should register and login with email password or oauth.
- user should be able to edit their profile details, such as avatar, username (only their own data)
- user profile should contain history of all the posts.

## Posts

- user should be able to add/delete posts to the feed (user can edit & delete only their own data).
- it should be possible to comment on post. (user can delete and edit only his own comments).
- it should be possible to like/unlike post.
- it should be possible to see the list of users who liked the post.

Tip: use Cloudinary for photo uploads

## [EXTRA] Connections

- user should be able to follow/unfollow other users
- user should be able to see posts of the users he is following

## [EXTRA] Chat

- user should be able to see/delete previous chats (they can see & delete only their own data).
- user should be able to search other users to start chat with by username.
- implement private 1on1 chat.
- implement messages that will disappear after 24 hours


Tips :

 - Use cloudinary to serve images
